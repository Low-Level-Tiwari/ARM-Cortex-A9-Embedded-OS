Creating a Bootable binary of u-boot:
---------------------------------------

1: Download u-boot source code from Github
2: Unzip the zip 
3: Set the cross compiler variable, 'export CROSS_COMPILER=arm-none-eabi-'
4: Set the archietecture variable, 'export ARCH=arm'
5: Run 'make vexpress_ca9x4_config'
6: Run 'make all'
7: For Unix/Linux like systems 'u-boot' is the output file

NOTE: Install libssl-dev using apt if promted






Automate/Customize Boot Process:
---------------------------------

1: Edit the config file for board  (u-boot/configs/vexpress_ca9x4_defconfig)
	
	1.1: Edit the CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND variable and set it to CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND="run someCommandName"
	1.2: 'someCommandName' is an alias for sequence of commands to be executed as the boot process

2: Edit the header file which Configures Boot Commands (u-boot/include/config_distro_bootcmd.h)

	2.1: Edit at the last by adding an entry for 'someCommandName' used earlier in config file
	2.2: Write the commands to be executed at the boot prompt 
	2.3: It should include mmc device selection, loading of bootable image and then bootm commands to load the kernel

3: Finally follow step 3-7 for making u-boot binary
